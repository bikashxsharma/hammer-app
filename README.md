*Social Media concept* 
>  Users can make posts, browse through others' post and react by giving a hammer ( identical to like reaction)

*Technology used*
- HTML/SCSS
- React

*Future plan*
- To use Google firebase for backend and database
- Attach real time stamp, and show latest post on top

*What I have done so far?*
- Created components for Post, Hammer, Post input & Navbar
- Added route /login, /signup, /home 
- Styled login page, signup page & home page
- Data is stored in local storage
- You can increase hammerCount by clicking on it
- You can try posting new post ( for now without login/sign up)

## How to run?
